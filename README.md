## Hi there, I'm [nubisub](https://nubisub.vercel.app/)

Oh, dear me, what a disaster of a GitHub repository we have here! It's like a tasteless, undercooked dish that should never have made it to the table. The code is a complete mess, leaving me with a bad taste in my mouth.

First of all, the organization is all over the place. It's like walking into a kitchen where ingredients are scattered haphazardly. Your files are named with no rhyme or reason, making it nearly impossible to find what I'm looking for. Did you ever hear about the concept of meaningful naming conventions?

And let's talk about your commit history, or should I say lack thereof? It's as if you don't even care about keeping track of your changes. A commit message like "Fix stuff" or "Update things" tells me absolutely nothing. It's like serving a dish without any description on the menu. How am I supposed to know what you've actually done?
